Knives Out 2019
★★★★½  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
a masterful understanding of the "who dunnit" genre, everything in this film, from the soundtrack to the cinematography and editing, oozes style. This is carried heavily by beautiful performances that see a mostly comedic film meld with latent tension that excites the entire viewing

★★★★  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
King's explosive biopic drips in finesse as it tackles Fred Hampton's life, his legacy, and the intertwining stories of those whose lives were highly involved with his

I would have preferred it if focused more on the Panthers and the rainbow coalition than the narrative that had to feature the police presence resulting in Hampton's untimely death though.

La La Land 2016
★★★½  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
I'm conflicted on how I feel about this film. While I love the dance sequences, the music, and above all, the setting that just oozes style and finesse (I cannot overstate how good watching this film feels), I can't say I was particularly engaged by the story Chazelle was trying to tell. I enjoyed the ending that stayed true to life, and whilst it firmly situates "La La Land" in realism, I'm not entirely sure if that was what I wanted out of this film. Regardless, its worth a watch for sure. Kudos Chazelle.

★★★★  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
The drum movie. My first Chazelle movie, and not going to lie, the soundtrack and music wowed me. The devastating and emotionally raw performances of the leads largely obscured most of my issues with this film. The relatively dynamic cinematography and tight, smooth, creative as heck editing really sealed the deal though.

Classic Spielburg. A film that is largely carried by its star-studded cast of stellar performances. While I can't highlight any shot compositions as being particularly interesting, the well-paced story, credit given to Spielburg's screenwriting and the editor's pacing, mean that the film dosen't overstay its welcome. I also dig biopics and historical films, so that's a plus in my book.

★★★★  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
One of the few Netflix orginals that I genuinely enjoyed. While there aren't a bevy of interesting shot choices, nor is there groundbreaking cinematography, the tight pacing and beautiful soundtrack carry this series. I also have to give credit to the editor for capturing the faded look of the 60s. While "The Queen's Gambit" isn't oozing in style, it definitely has style to spare. The story its trying to tell holds enough weight and realism to lend to the gravitas the show imbues Harmon's tale with.

Not bad. I really really enjoyed how pretty it was, how emotionally poingant the story this film is trying to tell is, and above all, how empty I felt at its conclusion. Perhaps the best thing about "Garden of Words" is the acceptance coupled with melancholy that soaks its ending, even as growth and love intertwine in perfect cohesion.

Watched this in 2017, so my memories of it are largely tainted by nostalgia. Ironically, that's what this movie is. As much as its storytelling is brilliant (credit going to the author of said manga of the same name), the conventional editing and camerawork means the film is nearly entirely carried by its emotionally poingant acting, the intrigue of the story's main gimmick, and the admittedly amazing soundtrack (that absolutely gutted me, and arguably elevates the film to a higher level).

I really enjoyed this movie. Much of it is a result of Song Kang Ho's commitment to his performance (as usual), though credit must be yielded to the supporting cast and set design, that catapults viewers into the chaos and violence of martial law in rural-urban Korea. An overall engaging film that relies heavily on its historical significance to dramatise its climax.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2016
★★ Rewatched 29 Apr 2021
I don't really have much to say about this movie. Despite enjoying it when I first viewed it in 2017, I can scarcely name a single memorable shot from the film now. This similarly applies for the movie's plot.

Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had been a Harry Potter/J.K Rowling fan.

"Wow haha Ryan Reynolds was so funny in this movie XD XD!"

To be fair, despite all the shit I give "Deadpool" for finding commercial acclaim, alongside its almost dead camera movement, I have to give credit where its due.

Ultimately, this is a movie worth your time if you can appreciate it as a comedic superhero movie. It barely strays from the 'superhero' formula, and despite its seemingly subversive humor, its plot is overall, very very safe.

Baby Driver 2017
★★★★  Rewatched 29 Apr 2021
While it might not come as a surprise to anyone that I found this movie "entertaining", or that I enjoyed "the use of sound and music", I find that the key achievment of "Baby Driver" is its visual flair.

Edgar Wright's knack for interesting shot composition and coloring is for me, akin to the iconic sequences of contemporaries like Wed Anderson.

Aside from Wright, and the editor's genius that went toward the perfect fusion of the soundtrack and the action, Wright's visuals-reliant characterisation of all of "Baby Driver's" cast means that, despite their seemingly shaky motivations, the grandiosity of 'Baby's' scheme is enough to carry the movie from start to finish.

Save Ralph 2021
★★★★½  Rewatched 29 Apr 2021
Another stop-motion animated short film. In this case, really short. Yet, for the 3 minutes of screentime that Ralph has, Susser is able to squeeze out his core message. The visuala perfectly complement the nuanced voice acting, conveying Ralph's stifled suffering and desires.

Here, Susser expounds upon the possibilities of stop-motion as a medium used to convey universally understood themes in a mature context. In doing so, "Save Ralph" highlights the potential of said medium, which have woefully remained underexplored.

If this commercial dosen't convince you to move against animal testing for any commercial product, you might be heartless.

★★★  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
While I consider "Free Solo" more a documentary than an actual movie, on the basis of it's very real subject matter, I find that the thrilling, gripping filmmaking that captures the intensity of Alex Honnold's physical, mental, and spiritual journey to solo El Capitan, commands the audience's attention and never lets go, from the moment audiences enter the theatre till the victorious ending.

Aside from this, the effort that went behind filming each and every shot in this movie adds to the awe I feel. This type of filmmaking is something I hope to have the priviledge of seeing more of in the future.

Fantastic Mr. Fox 2009
★★★★  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
Hey! I liked this movie. Very much in fact. Wes Anderson's foray into the world of stop-motion animation wherein he chose to explore Roald Dahl's beloved story could have easily resulted in a stale, safe children's movie.

Yet, under Anderson's masterful direction and tight pacing, coupled with his signature off-beat physical comedy, "Fantastic Mr.Fox" proves to be a timeless interpretation of Dahl's book. Interestingly, the movie holds something distinctly Andersonesque about it, even as it follows Dahl's narrative. Maybe that's what makes Wes such a compelling filmmaker. More than anything, his cinematography and tone are instantly recognisable, even when he's telling stories that aren't his.

Isle of Dogs 2018
★★★½  Rewatched 27 Apr 2021
This is by no means a bad film. Wes Anderson's prototypical camera work (in this doll-animated movie) shines through, carving out his distinct style further, whilst cementing this film as firmly within his province. The classic off-beat humor is as present within this movie as his other live action work.

Admittedly, Anderson knew what he was doing when he chose to work on yet another doll-animated film, paying tribute to his previous stelllar work, "The Fantastic Mr.Fox". While I can't say I enjoyed the fantastical setting of "Isle of Dogs" as much as I wish I had (the novelty of the slick, precise moving figurines soon wearing off), it no less proves to be an entertaining watch.

Hoo boy, this one was an absolute banger. It's been talked to death, and though it took some getting used to, the animation style used in this movie really floored me. Hard.

While I'm not a fan of 'Sunflower', I'm in awe of the bold stylistic decisions made in this film, with the comic book cell shaded art style seeing the movie's reality meld with comic book pop-ups and speech bubbles. I especially loved the small squiggly lines that brought the spidey sense to life.

★★★★½  Watched 26 May 2021
DAMN, did this anime surprise me. I've never considered myself someone who would pour time into watching a Netflix original, let alone a Netflix original anime, but "Great Pretender" came out of nowhere and slapped me across the cheek hard.

While "Great Pretender" seems to exist in a world akin to those every 007 movie seems to reside in, I'm not complaining. The plot is intriguing, the characters engaging, and the writing is overall, very strong. Yet, the most fascinating thing about season 1 is its visual flair. Every scene is a painting, and I say this in the most literal sense possible. The animation is dynamic, the voice acting brimming with life, but what floors me every time I watch this is the art direction. Splotches of maroon meld and clash with harsh tones of baby blue, abstraction intersplices with an uncanny depiction of real world locations- hell, the backgrounds are vivid whilst seemingly transporting the titular crew to otherworldly vistas.

I loved "Great Pretender", and will be revisiting it soon.

Damn bruh. The first of Nolan's films I got to experience, and it delivers.

Highly recommend, since its one of Nolan's more easily digestible films.

Satoshi Kon is a beast, and this is perhaps his best movie.

The few psychedelic sequences in this film far outrank anything I've seen from the animated industry in the past few years, and here, Kon is the least watered down in his exploration of the disturbing consequences of two foreign dimensions converging at once.

This movie... was genuinely good. The stop motion barely gets in the way of the storytelling, but its very obviously attempting to obfuscate what is fundamentally every pixar film produced in the last 10 years. Maybe that's what is so interesting about Kubo, that they dress it in a Japanese aesthetic, but leave every other aspect of his character rooted in western archetypes.

A Family 2020
★★★★★  Watched 26 Jul 2021
I really, really liked this movie.

It seems to tap into every 1990s Japanese Delinquent's fantasy, and though it can come off as self-indulgent, the sincerity of the acting and the depiction of the decline of a dynasty makes for a memorable, impactful watch. While the first half is admittedly slow, what comes after surges at the audience like a rushing tide.

The through line that runs deep throughout the entire movie is Ken's search for identity and a home, and seeing how Hiroshi and the Yakuza provide that for him amidst its decline in Japan's public consciousness is both heartbreaking and intensely personal. I also appreciate the intentional unpacking of Ken's circumstances, and the lives of those around him. The narrative might follow Ken's life, but this film is certainly not only about him. The way the Yakuza has wormed its way, for better and for worse, into each of the character's lives, is told brilliantly through visual masterpieces accompanied by a melancholic orchestral backing.

What new life can be found, and what is left behind?

Can someone consumed so heavily by the weight of his own sins find a way to survive? And does he deserve that right?

Does society have a place for those who cannot find work outside the Yakuza? Who will save them?

It seems that there are no answers at all. But that's life.

A Family examines the minute interactions we have with others on a daily basis, and the genuine heart behind every scene increased its emotional intensity nearing the end of the movie. Through it all, Ken's journey is fraught with struggle, turmoil and a pain that never leaves his eyes. Surely a broken, fragile man like him is deserving of redemption?

It's easy to shove this movie into a category of 'films that humanize the Yakuza', and it certainly does that, but I think beyond this intent, this film masks a tangible, human tale, of broken people hurtling toward each other, unable to separate their good motivations from self-destructive actions, and ultimately breaking each other.

This film is beautiful, and the soundscape and cinematography alone deserve their own analysis, but suffice it to say, I'll be watching this again soon.

Also, the last 15 minutes of this film killed me.

Genuinely hilarious.

Felt like I was watching gameplay from a bronze lobby in Rainbow Six Siege, Wick's trigger discipline is on a whole 'nother level.

On a more serious note, I could see the life drain out from Keanu's eyes as the movie progressed.

It's entertaining, for sure, but this was effectively a 2 hour showcase of how franchises alienate their main characters by stretching a fresh concept across three seperate outings.

Also, 'Zero' really channeled that NPC energy so hard from that one scene in the Continental he had me spitting out my drink.

Not sure why but I just really felt like crying the entirety of its runtime, the melancholy embedded in the music's probably what did it for me. Loved it 10/10.

Also? The manga is like? So good???

Damn. this was amazing to watch. Chloé Zhao is a dope director.

There's this one scene from Nomadland that I can't get out of my head. Its nearing the half-mark of the film, when Fern and Linda May visit this national park famous for the surrounding rock formations. In it, Fern leaves the tour group she's tethered to, and gets lost. She follows a twisting path, descending further and further into the labyrinth of stone and rock spires. When she finally turns around, she's alone.

There's a quiet beauty to Nomadland.

Frankly, I've wanted to watch it for the longest time, and now that I've seen it, I find there's something oddly cathartic about the opening minutes of Nomadland seeing Fern pissing in the foliage on a frigid winter evening.

Its weird, because it feels like there's so much I could talk about, yet at the same time, I really don't think any half-assed description I concoct could do this film justice. Suffice it to say, Nomadland looks at a lot of ideas, and how these affect those around us.

Still, what stuck with me long past the film's runtime was how authentic the story felt, and how beautiful every scene was. When the camerawork and soundscape are this brutal in their realism, interactions are brilliantly realized as actor's performances are given a weight that is startlingly heartfelt. The instrumental soundtrack also deserves credit for how it masterfully interweaves itself in the vignettes that Zhao meticulously constructs throughout the movie.

Also, it really had the cold opening of cold openings (cuz it was snowing lol).

Overall, Nomadland is refreshing, poignant and heavy. Really, just go watch it. It's so good.

I'll see you down the road, Nomadland.

Talking about the netflix anime; not the live-action movie

This is hilarious. The minimal (actually, more like non-existent) animation would have you believe its quality is akin to every other scuffass netflix anime production, but its a testament to how funny this show is that the jokes work just as well with a max of 25 panels per story.

Makes all the more sense knowing this was adapted off a manga series.

Review by 
gong
 ★★★★★  

“You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.”

Pretty discombobulating to watch something this unequivocally good and heartfelt after just watching ‘Dr Strange’s multiverse of madness.’

There’s probably some greater discussion to be had about the sudden influx of movies embracing the multiverse, though from what I can tell this film was definitely not created merely as a cash grab.

Instead of the usual “everything could have happened and so nothing matters” route that plots revolving around the multiverse tend to careen toward (be it implicitly or explicitly), the Daniels choose to posit that clinging to coherency amidst the madness is much more meaningful than embracing complete absurdity. 

All that, and it’s headed by such a stellar cast? I remember feeling a shot of goosebumps run all over me when Michelle Yeoh started conversing in mandarin.

Suffice it to say, I’ve yet to see a film so smartly tie together divergent plot threads, exposition, and unique ideas into such a sincere, satisfying and earnest package.

Ultimately, Everything Everywhere All at Once might be the best piece of media I’ve seen all year. It’s a film with a lot to say, but behind the flashy choreography (which is not at all to its detriment) and tight pacing, there is a heart-warming story of broken people trying to show love to each other by doing what they think is best. 

And I think we can all dig that.

Very Memories of Murder-esque in atmosphere and cinematography, though it loses some of Bong's original subtlety to its detriment.

Of course, there's something to be said for the fact that all noir films shot in that time period since 2003 have drawn comparison to Memories of Murder.

To its credit, I loved the colors in this film. A lot.

Classic Ghibli, definitely takes the cake as my new favourite in the war film genre, and might steal Princess Mononoke's spot for best Ghibli film (pending Kiki's Delivery Service).

Not sure how I've missed it up until now but all Ghibli movies have incredibly strong openings, and this is no exception.

It's wild to me how difficult it is to properly pin down what any Ghibli film is trying to get at while watching it, and then Miyazaki will swoop in at the 3/4 mark and tie all these disparate themes together in a package so cohesive it appears inextricable from the outset.

Seriously, this is Miyazaki at his most brilliant and unrestrained.

KPop Demon Hunters 2025
★★½  Watched 22 Jun 2025
Let me preface this by making it clear that I am on the diametric opposite side of whatever edge K-pop lies on the musical taste polygon.

Yet in spite of its core conceit, I actually really dug KPop Demon Hunters's premise and style-as-substance approach. The world-building is largely serviceable (though I wished there was more of it) and a rare few emotional beats genuinely gave me chills (no doubt in part due to the music).

That's probably why I feel all the more let-down that I didn't get what I wanted from this film.

I'm a sucker for themes and character writing, and while I sometimes got the sense that there was something really important being said about fan (and idol) culture, I can't help but wish for tighter plotting that focused more on Rumi, Mira and Zoey's own demons instead of the obvious big bad that is literally consuming people via mind control.

But at that point I'm just asking for a different movie instead of the one I got.

+ Extra points that there's an in-universe reason everyone can spontaneously break into song, musical movies don't rationalize that shit enough.

Poster for Joker: Folie à Deux (2024)
Joker: Folie à Deux 2024
★★½  Watched 28 Jul 2025
Same sentiments towards this as the first one.

Never have I been more frustrated by a film that demonstrates such a high level of craft to accompany it's abysmally low level of screenwriting.

Primer 2004
★★★  Watched 27 Jul 2025
“Don’t try to feel it, understand it”

Its quite silly how Primer lies on the complete other end of the time travel narrative spectrum as Tenet, yet emerges with a story somehow more uninteresting than Nolan's 2020 blockbuster.

It's sad because I really wanted to enjoy this film, but I can't help but feel that in its obsession to get viewers on board with its tech, Primer loses the willpower to deliver any kind of compelling narrative.

All that said, this is an incredibly strong showing for a debut feature.

Y'know, upon reflection maybe Shane Carruth is pulling wool over my eyes and painting a much wider big brain meta-narrative with the film itself, seeing as my main issue with Primer is the same reason most startups aren't able to secure VC funding.

Being so in love with its intelligent premise and smart mechanics that it forgets to do any meaningful storytelling.

An extremely smart whodunit that isn't bogged down by it's own intelligence, made all the better by excellently done character writing.

All thriller animes should be like this.

Talking about the anime, not the live-adaptation film.

Mind-bogglingly underated. 10/10 character writing, 10/10 world building, 10/10 plotting, 10/10 art. Even now I'm struggling to understanding why more people aren't talking about this.

And that burnt field scene? Gas.
