Damn bruh. The first of Nolan's films I got to experience, and it delivers. Nolan's penchant for bombastic action sequences really impresses here, though what is more astounding is how he visually translates abstract, layered concepts whilst successfully advancing the movie's plot. Highly recommend, since its one of Nolan's more easily digestible films.
