Extremely functional and in all respects, an extremely well-made series. Lazarus is pulled along by it's intriguing premise, fantastic character writing and voice acting.

Just a shame that it's execution ended up being as heavy-handed as it was. I regretably found the last 3 minutes of Episode 13 to be the most compelling I ever found the show.

That, and anyone would have a hard time following up Cowboy Bebop.
