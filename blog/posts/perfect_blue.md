What happens when your persona begins to consume your person?

Satoshi Kon is a beast, and this is perhaps his best movie.

The few psychedelic sequences in this film far outrank anything I've seen from the animated industry in the past few years, and here, Kon is the least watered down in his exploration of the disturbing consequences of two foreign dimensions converging at once.
