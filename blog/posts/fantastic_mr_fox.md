Hey! I liked this movie. Very much in fact. Wes Anderson's foray into the world of stop-motion animation wherein he chose to explore Roald Dahl's beloved story could have easily resulted in a stale, safe children's movie.

Yet, under Anderson's masterful direction and tight pacing, coupled with his signature off-beat physical comedy, "Fantastic Mr.Fox" proves to be a timeless interpretation of Dahl's book. Interestingly, the movie holds something distinctly Andersonesque about it, even as it follows Dahl's narrative. Maybe that's what makes Wes such a compelling filmmaker. More than anything, his cinematography and tone are instantly recognisable, even when he's telling stories that aren't his.
