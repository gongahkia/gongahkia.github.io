2 hrs 5 minutes of Stephen Strange gaslighting the Scarlett Witch

I remember watching the first Strange movie and adoring it for how unique it was at the time.

This one was good to, though Marvel’s over the top slap-my-thigh cinema humour is definitely palpable.

Benedict Cumberbatch really out here trying to kickstart his TikTok career to get sponsored by Bang Energy huh.
