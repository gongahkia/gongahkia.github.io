I really enjoyed this movie. Much of it is a result of Song Kang Ho's commitment to his performance (as usual), though credit must be yielded to the supporting cast and set design, that catapults viewers into the chaos and violence of martial law in rural-urban Korea. An overall engaging film that relies heavily on its historical significance to dramatise its climax.
