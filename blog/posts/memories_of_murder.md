BRO. Bong Jun Ho and Song Kang Ho? This movie absolutely hits it out of the park. Every beat is timed and executed with masterful precision. The soundtrack and atmosphere intertwine with Bong's dark humor and tight storyboarding to create this legendary film.

Knowing the reality and context of said movie only adds to how awesome this film is.
