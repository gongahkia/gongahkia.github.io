This is by no means a bad film. Wes Anderson's prototypical camera work (in this doll-animated movie) shines through, carving out his distinct style further, whilst cementing this film as firmly within his province. The classic off-beat humor is as present within this movie as his other live action work.

Admittedly, Anderson knew what he was doing when he chose to work on yet another doll-animated film, paying tribute to his previous stelllar work, "The Fantastic Mr.Fox". While I can't say I enjoyed the fantastical setting of "Isle of Dogs" as much as I wish I had (the novelty of the slick, precise moving figurines soon wearing off), it no less proves to be an entertaining watch.
