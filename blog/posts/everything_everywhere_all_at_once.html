        <p><em>“You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.”</em></p>
<p>Pretty discombobulating to watch something this unequivocally good and heartfelt after just watching ‘Dr Strange’s multiverse of madness.’</p>
<p>There’s probably some greater discussion to be had about the sudden influx of movies embracing the multiverse, though from what I can tell this film was definitely not created merely as a cash grab.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual “everything could have happened and so nothing matters” route that plots revolving around the multiverse tend to careen toward (be it implicitly or explicitly), the Daniels choose to posit that clinging to coherency amidst the madness is much more meaningful than embracing complete absurdity. </p>
<p>All that, and it’s headed by such a stellar cast? I remember feeling a shot of goosebumps run all over me when Michelle Yeoh started conversing in mandarin.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, I’ve yet to see a film so smartly tie together divergent plot threads, exposition, and unique ideas into such a sincere, satisfying and earnest package.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Everything Everywhere All at Once might be the best piece of media I’ve seen all year. It’s a film with a lot to say, but behind the flashy choreography (which is not at all to its detriment) and tight pacing, there is a heart-warming story of broken people trying to show love to each other by doing what they think is best. </p>
<p>And I think we can all dig that.</p>
