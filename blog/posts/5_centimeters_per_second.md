great Shinkai film, I loved the backgrounds and the painful reality of lost love and wistful longing put into this movie really hit home.

But its been 6 months since I watched it and I can't remember any of the characters, whereas I watched your name in 2016 and I still remember Taki's stupid friend giving him a riceball at lunch lol
