While I consider "Free Solo" more a documentary than an actual movie, on the basis of it's very real subject matter, I find that the thrilling, gripping filmmaking that captures the intensity of Alex Honnold's physical, mental, and spiritual journey to solo El Capitan, commands the audience's attention and never lets go, from the moment audiences enter the theatre till the victorious ending.

Aside from this, the effort that went behind filming each and every shot in this movie adds to the awe I feel. This type of filmmaking is something I hope to have the priviledge of seeing more of in the future.
