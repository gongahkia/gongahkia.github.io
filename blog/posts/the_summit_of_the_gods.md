This film has no right being as good as it is.

Soundtrack, mmm its beautiful.

Art direction, oh yeah baby.

Not sure why but I just really felt like crying the entirety of its runtime, the melancholy embedded in the music's probably what did it for me. Loved it 10/10.

Also? The manga is like? So good???
