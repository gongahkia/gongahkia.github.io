“Don’t try to feel it, understand it”

Its quite silly how Primer lies on the complete other end of the time travel narrative spectrum as Tenet, yet emerges with a story somehow more uninteresting than Nolan's 2020 blockbuster.

It's sad because I really wanted to enjoy this film, but I can't help but feel that in its obsession to get viewers on board with its tech, Primer loses the willpower to deliver any kind of compelling narrative.

All that said, this is an incredibly strong showing for a debut feature.

Y'know, upon reflection maybe Shane Carruth is pulling wool over my eyes and painting a much wider big brain meta-narrative with the film itself, seeing as my main issue with Primer is the same reason most startups aren't able to secure VC funding.

Being so in love with its intelligent premise and smart mechanics that it forgets to do any meaningful storytelling.
