I'm conflicted on how I feel about this film. While I love the dance sequences, the music, and above all, the setting that just oozes style and finesse (I cannot overstate how good watching this film feels), I can't say I was particularly engaged by the story Chazelle was trying to tell. I enjoyed the ending that stayed true to life, and whilst it firmly situates "La La Land" in realism, I'm not entirely sure if that was what I wanted out of this film. Regardless, its worth a watch for sure. Kudos Chazelle.
