WOW. I really enjoyed this. It's effectively more of John Wick's world, except now Keanu is older and moves like an animated doll in blendr that dosen't have any animated joints.

Still, I appreciated the bossfight at the end, really was on that JOJO shit until the last minute of the film became Darude Sandstorm.
