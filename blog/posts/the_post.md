Classic Spielburg. A film that is largely carried by its star-studded cast of stellar performances. While I can't highlight any shot compositions as being particularly interesting, the well-paced story, credit given to Spielburg's screenwriting and the editor's pacing, mean that the film dosen't overstay its welcome. I also dig biopics and historical films, so that's a plus in my book.
