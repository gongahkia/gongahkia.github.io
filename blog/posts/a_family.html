      <section class="review-content">
        <p>I really, really liked this movie.</p>
<p>It seems to tap into every 1990s Japanese Delinquent's fantasy, and though it can come off as self-indulgent, the sincerity of the acting and the depiction of the decline of a dynasty makes for a memorable, impactful watch. While the first half is admittedly slow, what comes after surges at the audience like a rushing tide.</p>
<p>The through line that runs deep throughout the entire movie is Ken's search for identity and a home, and seeing how Hiroshi and the Yakuza provide that for him amidst its decline in Japan's public consciousness is both heartbreaking and intensely personal. I also appreciate the intentional unpacking of Ken's circumstances, and the lives of those around him. The narrative might follow Ken's life, but this film is certainly not only about him. The way the Yakuza has wormed its way, for better and for worse, into each of the character's lives, is told brilliantly through visual masterpieces accompanied by a melancholic orchestral backing.</p>
<p>What new life can be found, and what is left behind?</p>
<p>Can someone consumed so heavily by the weight of his own sins find a way to survive? And does he deserve that right?</p>
<p>Does society have a place for those who cannot find work outside the Yakuza? Who will save them?</p>
<p>It seems that there are no answers at all. But that's life.</p>
<p>A Family examines the minute interactions we have with others on a daily basis, and the genuine heart behind every scene increased its emotional intensity nearing the end of the movie. Through it all, Ken's journey is fraught with struggle, turmoil and a pain that never leaves his eyes. Surely a broken, fragile man like him is deserving of redemption?</p>
<p>It's easy to shove this movie into a category of 'films that humanize the Yakuza', and it certainly does that, but I think beyond this intent, this film masks a tangible, human tale, of broken people hurtling toward each other, unable to separate their good motivations from self-destructive actions, and ultimately breaking each other.</p>
<p>This film is beautiful, and the soundscape and cinematography alone deserve their own analysis, but suffice it to say, I'll be watching this again soon.</p>
<p>Also, the last 15 minutes of this film killed me.</p>
