The drum movie. My first Chazelle movie, and not going to lie, the soundtrack and music wowed me. The devastating and emotionally raw performances of the leads largely obscured most of my issues with this film. The relatively dynamic cinematography and tight, smooth, creative as heck editing really sealed the deal though.
