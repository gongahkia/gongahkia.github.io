This movie... was genuinely good. The stop motion barely gets in the way of the storytelling, but its very obviously attempting to obfuscate what is fundamentally every pixar film produced in the last 10 years. Maybe that's what is so interesting about Kubo, that they dress it in a Japanese aesthetic, but leave every other aspect of his character rooted in western archetypes.
