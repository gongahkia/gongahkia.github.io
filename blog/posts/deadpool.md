"Wow haha Ryan Reynolds was so funny in this movie XD XD!"

To be fair, despite all the shit I give "Deadpool" for finding commercial acclaim, alongside its almost dead camera movement, I have to give credit where its due.

Ultimately, this is a movie worth your time if you can appreciate it as a comedic superhero movie. It barely strays from the 'superhero' formula, and despite its seemingly subversive humor, its plot is overall, very very safe.
