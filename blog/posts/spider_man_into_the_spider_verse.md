Hoo boy, this one was an absolute banger. It's been talked to death, and though it took some getting used to, the animation style used in this movie really floored me. Hard.

While I'm not a fan of 'Sunflower', I'm in awe of the bold stylistic decisions made in this film, with the comic book cell shaded art style seeing the movie's reality meld with comic book pop-ups and speech bubbles. I especially loved the small squiggly lines that brought the spidey sense to life.
