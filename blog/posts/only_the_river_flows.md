This review may contain spoilers.

Very Memories of Murder-esque in atmosphere and cinematography, though it loses some of Bong's original subtlety to its detriment.

Of course, there's something to be said for the fact that all noir films shot in that time period since 2003 have drawn comparison to Memories of Murder.

To its credit, I loved the colors in this film. A lot.
