Talking about the netflix anime; not the live-action movie

This is hilarious. The minimal (actually, more like non-existent) animation would have you believe its quality is akin to every other scuffass netflix anime production, but its a testament to how funny this show is that the jokes work just as well with a max of 25 panels per story.

Makes all the more sense knowing this was adapted off a manga series.
