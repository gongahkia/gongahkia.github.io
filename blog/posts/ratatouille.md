Again, it seems pre-2010 pixar were producing some absolute bangers. The more outlandish the plot, the better the movie is, and this is no exception.

Also, might I add, the graphical fidelity with which much of the food in 'Ratatouille' is rendered is astounding for a 2007 movie, while the music and pizzazz is what gives this movie its spunk. Loved it.
