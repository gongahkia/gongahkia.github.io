Genuinely hilarious.

Felt like I was watching gameplay from a bronze lobby in Rainbow Six Siege, Wick's trigger discipline is on a whole 'nother level.

On a more serious note, I could see the life drain out from Keanu's eyes as the movie progressed.

It's entertaining, for sure, but this was effectively a 2 hour showcase of how franchises alienate their main characters by stretching a fresh concept across three seperate outings.

Also, 'Zero' really channeled that NPC energy so hard from that one scene in the Continental he had me spitting out my drink.
