While it might not come as a surprise to anyone that I found this movie "entertaining", or that I enjoyed "the use of sound and music", I find that the key achievment of "Baby Driver" is its visual flair.

Edgar Wright's knack for interesting shot composition and coloring is for me, akin to the iconic sequences of contemporaries like Wed Anderson.

Aside from Wright, and the editor's genius that went toward the perfect fusion of the soundtrack and the action, Wright's visuals-reliant characterisation of all of "Baby Driver's" cast means that, despite their seemingly shaky motivations, the grandiosity of 'Baby's' scheme is enough to carry the movie from start to finish.
