Watched this in 2017, so my memories of it are largely tainted by nostalgia. Ironically, that's what this movie is. As much as its storytelling is brilliant (credit going to the author of said manga of the same name), the conventional editing and camerawork means the film is nearly entirely carried by its emotionally poingant acting, the intrigue of the story's main gimmick, and the admittedly amazing soundtrack (that absolutely gutted me, and arguably elevates the film to a higher level).
