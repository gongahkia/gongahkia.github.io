Not bad. I really really enjoyed how pretty it was, how emotionally poingant the story this film is trying to tell is, and above all, how empty I felt at its conclusion. Perhaps the best thing about "Garden of Words" is the acceptance coupled with melancholy that soaks its ending, even as growth and love intertwine in perfect cohesion.
