Another intriguing take on the horror film, Peele delivers a story that hits startlingly close to home for anyone suffering from imposter syndrome and those struggling to determine their identity. While I can't say I was able to understand and appreciate the full meaning of "Us", I enjoyed it enough as a piece of subversive horror.
