One of the few Netflix orginals that I genuinely enjoyed. While there aren't a bevy of interesting shot choices, nor is there groundbreaking cinematography, the tight pacing and beautiful soundtrack carry this series. I also have to give credit to the editor for capturing the faded look of the 60s. While "The Queen's Gambit" isn't oozing in style, it definitely has style to spare. The story its trying to tell holds enough weight and realism to lend to the gravitas the show imbues Harmon's tale with.
