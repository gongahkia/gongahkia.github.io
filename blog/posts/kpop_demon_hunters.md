Let me preface this by making it clear that I am on the diametric opposite side of whatever edge K-pop lies on the musical taste polygon.

Yet in spite of its core conceit, I actually really dug KPop Demon Hunters's premise and style-as-substance approach. The world-building is largely serviceable (though I wished there was more of it) and a rare few emotional beats genuinely gave me chills (no doubt in part due to the music).

That's probably why I feel all the more let-down that I didn't get what I wanted from this film.

I'm a sucker for themes and character writing, and while I sometimes got the sense that there was something really important being said about fan (and idol) culture, I can't help but wish for tighter plotting that focused more on Rumi, Mira and Zoey's own demons instead of the obvious big bad that is literally consuming people via mind control.

But at that point I'm just asking for a different movie instead of the one I got.

+ Extra points that there's an in-universe reason everyone can spontaneously break into song, musical movies don't rationalize that shit enough.
