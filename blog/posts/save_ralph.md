Another stop-motion animated short film. In this case, really short. Yet, for the 3 minutes of screentime that Ralph has, Susser is able to squeeze out his core message. The visuala perfectly complement the nuanced voice acting, conveying Ralph's stifled suffering and desires.

Here, Susser expounds upon the possibilities of stop-motion as a medium used to convey universally understood themes in a mature context. In doing so, "Save Ralph" highlights the potential of said medium, which have woefully remained underexplored.

If this commercial dosen't convince you to move against animal testing for any commercial product, you might be heartless.
