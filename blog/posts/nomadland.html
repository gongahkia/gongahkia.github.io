        <p>Damn. this was amazing to watch. Chloé Zhao is a dope director.</p>
<p>There's this one scene from Nomadland that I can't get out of my head. Its nearing the half-mark of the film, when Fern and Linda May visit this national park famous for the surrounding rock formations. In it, Fern leaves the tour group she's tethered to, and gets lost. She follows a twisting path, descending further and further into the labyrinth of stone and rock spires. When she finally turns around, she's alone.</p>
<p>There's a quiet beauty to Nomadland.</p>
<p>Frankly, I've wanted to watch it for the longest time, and now that I've seen it, I find there's something oddly cathartic about the opening minutes of Nomadland seeing Fern pissing in the foliage on a frigid winter evening.</p>
<p>Its weird, because it feels like there's so much I could talk about, yet at the same time, I really don't think any half-assed description I concoct could do this film justice. Suffice it to say, Nomadland looks at a lot of ideas, and how these affect those around us.</p>
<p>Still, what stuck with me long past the film's runtime was how authentic the story felt, and how beautiful every scene was. When the camerawork and soundscape are this brutal in their realism, interactions are brilliantly realized as actor's performances are given a weight that is startlingly heartfelt. The instrumental soundtrack also deserves credit for how it masterfully interweaves itself in the vignettes that Zhao meticulously constructs throughout the movie.</p>
<p>Also, it really had the cold opening of cold openings (cuz it was snowing lol).</p>
<p>Overall, Nomadland is refreshing, poignant and heavy. Really, just go watch it. It's so good.</p>
<p>I'll see you down the road, Nomadland.</p>
