# Hello there!

> This post was written in Rmarkdown, and compiled to a `.html` document with `pandoc` and `R`.

I finally decided to try my hand at hosting a blog with a focus on more *techical content*.   

I will continue to maintain [my wordpress blog](https://gongzm.wordpress.com/), but I hope to be able to post here occasionally, perhaps once a month.

Self-introductions aside, I don't actually have much technical content to discuss today. I've been dabbling with **Rust** recently, and have fallen in love with its *awesome type system* and *clear error messages*. Highly recommend trying Rust, especially if you've only been using dynamic languages. There's a whole world out there!

With that, I think I'll take my leave here. See ya around!

```{rust}
let mut ending_collection:Vec<String> = Vec::new();
ending_collection.push(String::from("that's all folks!"));
ending_collection.push(String::from("smell ya later, nerd"));
fn main() {
    println!("{}", awesome_possum);
}

// I'll have to figure out how to enable proper syntax highlighting for Rust 
// code blocks without using html_vignette as the output format for Rmarkdown
```
