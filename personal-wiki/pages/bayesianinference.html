        <h1><code>Bayesian Inference</code></h1>
<p>Notes on the 3Blue1Brown series "Probabilities of probabilities," which provides an introduction to the core ideas of Bayesian inference.</p>
<h2>Introduction: The Bayesian View</h2>
<p>Bayesian inference is a framework for thinking about probability as a measure of belief in a proposition. The core idea is to update our beliefs in the light of new evidence. This is in contrast to the frequentist interpretation of probability, which sees probability as the long-run frequency of an event.</p>
<h2>Bayes' Theorem</h2>
<p>The mathematical engine of Bayesian inference is Bayes' Theorem. It tells us how to update our belief in a hypothesis (<span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span>) after observing some evidence (<span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span>).</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]</div>
<p>Let's break down the terms:<br />
*   <span class="arithmatex">\(P(H|E)\)</span>: The <strong>Posterior</strong>. This is the probability of our hypothesis being true, given the evidence. This is what we want to calculate.<br />
*   <span class="arithmatex">\(P(E|H)\)</span>: The <strong>Likelihood</strong>. This is the probability of observing the evidence, assuming our hypothesis is true.<br />
*   <span class="arithmatex">\(P(H)\)</span>: The <strong>Prior</strong>. This is our initial belief in the hypothesis, before we've seen any evidence.<br />
*   <span class="arithmatex">\(P(E)\)</span>: The <strong>Marginal Likelihood</strong>. This is the total probability of observing the evidence, under all possible hypotheses. It acts as a normalization constant.</p>
<p>In practice, we often write the theorem as:<br />
$$ <br />
\text{Posterior} \propto \text{Likelihood} \cdot \text{Prior}<br />
$$ </p>
<h2>From Numbers to Distributions</h2>
<p>In many real-world problems, we are not interested in a single probability, but a continuous range of possibilities. For example, instead of asking "is this coin fair?", we might ask "what is the probability of this coin landing heads?". This is a value that could be anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>In the Bayesian framework, we can represent our belief about this unknown probability with a <strong>probability distribution</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Beta Distribution</h2>
<p>The Beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1]. It is a very natural choice for representing a belief about a probability. It is defined by two positive shape parameters, <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ 
\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
\]</div>
<ul>
<li>The mean of the distribution is <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The shape of the distribution can be interpreted as representing the knowledge gained from <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha - 1\)</span> "successes" and <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta - 1\)</span> "failures".</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a flat prior (representing no knowledge) can be modeled with a Beta(1, 1) distribution, which is a uniform distribution.</p>
<h2>Conjugate Priors</h2>
<p>The Beta distribution has a very special relationship with the binomial distribution (which describes the number of successes in a series of independent trials). The Beta distribution is a <strong>conjugate prior</strong> for the binomial likelihood.</p>
<p>This means that if you:<br />
1.  Start with a <strong>prior</strong> belief about a probability, represented by a Beta distribution, <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)\)</span>.<br />
2.  Observe new evidence in the form of <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> successes and <span class="arithmatex">\(n-k\)</span> failures.<br />
3.  Your <strong>posterior</strong> belief will also be a Beta distribution, with updated parameters:<br />
    $$ <br />
    \text{Beta}(\alpha + k, \beta + n - k)<br />
    $$ </p>
<p>This makes calculations much easier and provides a very intuitive way to think about updating beliefs. You just add the number of successes to <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> and the number of failures to <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<h2>Example: Coin Flipping</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to determine the fairness of a coin.<br />
*   <strong>Prior:</strong> You have no idea if it's fair, so you start with a uniform prior, <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Beta}(1, 1)\)</span>.<br />
*   <strong>Evidence:</strong> You flip the coin 10 times and get 7 heads and 3 tails.<br />
*   <strong>Posterior:</strong> Your new belief about the coin's probability of landing heads is represented by the distribution <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Beta}(1+7, 1+3) = \text{Beta}(8, 4)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The peak of this new distribution is at <span class="arithmatex">\(7/10 = 0.7\)</span>, which is our most likely estimate for the probability of heads. But the distribution also tells us about our uncertainty; there's still a chance the coin is fair, or even biased towards tails.</p>
<h2>Bayesian A/B Testing</h2>
<p>This framework can be applied to A/B testing. Instead of p-values, we can directly calculate the probability that variant B is better than variant A. We can model our belief about the conversion rate of each variant with a Beta distribution, update it with new data, and then compare the posterior distributions.</p>
